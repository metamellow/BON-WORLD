# ----- TODO -----
- add a (25/50/max option for staking) that pulls from balance
- need to add the passed time text to the staked time (in days and hours) even if its in the label
- it seems like the timerbar either shows 100 or 0 ....
- update ALL the text ON BUTTONS to have a cool little shadow (like the progress bar)
- make the button text a little smoother; like if its empty, then show an empty icon


- Need to edit/create/format the BANK to BON stuff
