      <h1>From Chad to You: Sharing the Rewards!</h1>
      <p>Here at ChadGPT, we believe in giving back to those who are with us. That's why we follow a clear plan for distributing the fees we receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>30% for our valued Alpha staking participants: If you've chosen to embark on the Alpha staking journey, you'll receive a generous slice of 30% of the fees. We recognize your support and look forward to rewarding you.</li>
        <li>10% for proud ChadNFT holders: If you own the precious ChadNFT, you'll receive a special reward of 10% of the fees. Hold your ChadNFT with pride and enjoy exclusive benefits.</li>
        <li>15% for purchasing token X and airdrops for Alpha staking participants: Every seven days, we'll distribute exclusive airdrops to you.</li>
        <li>15% for ChadNFT holders: The ChadNFT community will also be rewarded with a 15% share of the fees. We value your loyalty and want you to enjoy ongoing advantages.</li>
        <li>10% for our amazing development team: We allocate 10% of the fees to our development team, who work tirelessly to enhance and expand the ChadGPT platform. Their hard work is essential to our success.</li>
        <li>10% dedicated to marketing: We understand the importance of spreading the word about ChadGPT and attracting more people to our community. We allocate 10% of the fees to our marketing efforts, reaching a broader audience and sharing our vision.</li>
        <li>10% for token burning: We recognize the importance of increasing scarcity and the value of ChadGPT tokens. Therefore, we reserve 10% of the fees for token burning, making each holder's participation increasingly valuable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These distributions will occur regularly every seven days for a period of four weeks. We will select token X as our partner for purchase and redistribution to Alpha staking participants and ChadNFT holders. This is our way of demonstrating camaraderie and sharing success with our loyal community.</p>
