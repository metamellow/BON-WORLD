    <h1>Modulusverse - Decentralized Education through Art and Technology</h1>
<img src="donate.png">
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>
      The Modulusverse is an entrepreneurial initiative that began in March 2023 with the goal of educating Cult.dao members about various protocols, emphasizing decentralization in a creative and playful manner. Our proposal is to create charismatic characters that represent community tokens and convey knowledge through animations and comic books. We aim to involve artists from various fields, such as character modelers, illustrators, programmers, and other talents, to create high-quality content and expand our community.
    </p>

    <h2>Development:</h2>
    <p>
      Over time, we have achieved some significant milestones, including the creation of four characters - CULT, RVLT, TRG, and BON. However, we don't plan to stop there as we have plans to expand the Modulusverse universe with new characters and stories that provide a unique experience for our members.
    </p>
    <p>
      To achieve our goals, we are committed to allocating financial resources intelligently. So far, we have primarily funded the project through sales of NFTs and RVLT tokens. Unfortunately, we have faced recent challenges with RVLT fluctuations, which have impacted the project's development. However, we are resilient and will continue to explore other funding opportunities to ensure the continuity and growth of Modulusverse.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Team:</h2>
    <p>
      The solid foundation of Modulusverse is a diverse team of talented artists and developers dedicated to bringing this unique universe to life. Our team includes character modelers, 3D artists, illustrators, comic book colorists, programmers, and creative writers. Fair and decentralized payment for these professionals is one of our priorities, ensuring they feel valued and motivated to contribute their best skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Achievements:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12 educational Shorts in animation, sharing valuable information about our community;</li>
      <li>4 charismatic characters representing important tokens;</li>

      <li>1 engaging 6-page comic book;</li>
      <li>1 basic HTML website, which we plan to update for an improved user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Development Plan for the Next 12 Months:</h2>
    <p>
      We are committed to continuous growth and improvement of Modulusverse. Our plans for the next 12 months include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Producing a new 6-page comic book each month, offering relevant and engaging content;</li>
      <li>Resuming weekly Shorts production, providing ongoing learning for the community;</li>

      <li>Creating more 3D animations, expanding artistic and educational possibilities;</li>
      <li>Investing in website technology improvements for better performance and usability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Funding Needs:</h2>
    <p>
      To achieve our ambitious goals and keep the team of artists and developers engaged, we are seeking funding for the next 12 months. The resources obtained will be used for fair compensation of the professionals involved and the continuous sustainability of Modulusverse.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
      The Modulusverse is a journey of decentralized education through art and technology. Our dedicated team will continue to explore new ways to disseminate knowledge about protocols and decentralization, always focusing on quality and user experience. With the support of funders, partners, and an engaged community, we are eager to build a promising future for Modulusverse. Join us on this exciting adventure!
